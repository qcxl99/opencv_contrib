// The platform-neutral core exists so the plan layer and the runtime do not have

// pointers, sizes and strides; the GpuMat adapter in opencv2/triton.hpp validates
// its arguments, unwraps them into an ImageView/ExecutionContext pair and calls
// resizeCore() here.
//
// An earlier revision shipped this header under include/opencv2/triton/ with
// CV_EXPORTS on every type, which made a raw device-pointer API part of the
// installed surface while the same file said callers should not use it. Nothing
// in the module or its tests needs it from outside, so it is now private.

/** @brief Describes one device-resident image buffer for the core API.

 * Carries byte pitch, not element stride, because that is what device
 * pointer arithmetic needs. whole_* records the parent allocation so a ROI
 * view addresses correctly (both backends already key off the real step,
 * the same contract a ROI GpuMat reports) -- set whole_rows/whole_cols equal
 * to rows/cols and offset_x/offset_y to 0 for a non-ROI/top-level buffer.
 *
 * MODULE-INTERNAL: see the note at the top of this file.

 * This performs every check cv::triton::resize(GpuMat...) performs (depth,
 * channels, interpolation, explicit dsize, in-place rejection, overlap
 * rejection -- ROI src/dst are accepted, not rejected) against the
 * ImageView/ExecutionContext pair directly, with no GpuMat, no cuda::Stream
 * and no CUDA/HIP header dependency. `dst` must already be allocated to
 * `dsize` by the caller: unlike
 * the GpuMat adapter, this layer never allocates (it has no OutputArray to
 * allocate through).
 *
 * @param src   Source image view, CV_8U or CV_32F, 1/3/4 channels, ROI
 *              views accepted.
 * @param dst   Destination image view, already sized to dsize, ROI views
 *              accepted, not aliased with src.
 * @param dsize Explicit output size. Must equal dst's size.
 * @param interpolation INTER_NEAREST, INTER_LINEAR, INTER_CUBIC or INTER_AREA.
 * @param ctx   Device and stream that own src/dst.
 * @param scaleX Kernel-space horizontal scale (src cols per dst pixel), or 0 to derive the
 *               computation from dsize alone. When both scales are given, their inverses are
 *               used as cv::resize's fx/fy, and dsize must equal cvRound(src * (1/scale)).
 *               1/(1/fx) is not always fx in double: a caller holding the original fx/fy that
 *               needs bit-exactness with cv::resize(fx, fy) should use the GpuMat entry,
 *               which passes them through unchanged.
 * @param scaleY Kernel-space vertical scale (src rows per dst pixel). 0
 *               derives it as src.rows / dsize.height; see scaleX.
