// Module-private CUDA/HIP JIT runtime. Not installed.
//
// resize(), cvtColor() and warpAffine() validate requests before device submission.
// resize supports NEAREST, LINEAR, CUBIC and AREA, including fractional AREA;
// the other operators define their supported combinations in their provider headers.
//
// Binaries are resolved through the process-local module cache, the verified disk
// cache, or a separate Torch-free compile-helper process. Python is not embedded.
// Resize coordinate/coefficient tables are built in C++, uploaded on the caller's
// stream, and made visible to other streams through events. Launch arguments are
// checked against the verified manifest and supported compiler ABI.
//
// Modules and tables remain alive until their launches complete. Captured graphs
// retain resources until releaseCapturePins() is called. Cache eviction drops only
// the cache reference; potentially blocking driver cleanup runs outside the state
// mutex. First use of a key may compile, load a module, allocate and upload tables.
